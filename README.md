# Modify Efficiency

This program is to find and replace incorrect efficiencies of instruments used. 
The values for their efficiency rating can easily be changed by modifying the values in the json file.

Use command
```pyinstaller --onefile GUI.spec```
This will create an exe file which can then be run.
