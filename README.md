# Data Extraction

This program was developed with the intention of created an automated process to allow easy data extraction when handling large file sets. This program allows control across multiple survey types: Air Samples, Surveys, and FSS Surveys. Along with extracting this data it will also generate some of the most common statistics desired. Including Min, Max, Average, and standard deviation.

## Air Samples
Reads air sample data and sorts them based on the location and creates a trending plot to show the change in detections over time.


## Surveys

## FSS Surveys
